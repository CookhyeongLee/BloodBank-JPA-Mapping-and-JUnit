 * The persistent class for the address database table.

//Hint - @Entity marks this class as an entity which needs to be mapped by JPA.
//Hint - @Entity does not need a name if the name of the class is sufficient.
//Hint - @Entity name does not matter as long as it is consistent across the code.
@Entity
//Hint - @Table defines a specific table on DB which is mapped to this entity.

//Hint - @NamedQuery attached to this class which uses JPQL/HQL.  SQL cannot be used with NamedQuery.
//Hint - @NamedQuery uses the name which is defined in @Entity for JPQL, if no name is defined use class name.
//Hint - @NamedNativeQuery can optionally be used if there is a need for SQL query.

	// Hint - @Column is for mapping and creation (if needed) of an object to DB.

	// Hint - @OneToMany option cascade can be added to define if changes to this entity should cascade to objects.
